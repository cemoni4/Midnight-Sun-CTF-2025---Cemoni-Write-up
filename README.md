# üïõ Midnight Sun CTF 2025 - Cemoni Write-up

This repository contains the write-up for the **Cemoni** challenge from the Midnight Sun CTF 2025.

**Category:** `Misc`
**Challenge URL:** `cccemoni.play.hfsc.tf:11223`

## üß© Challenge Description

> It seems the challenge wants us to play and solve.
> Do not be fooled by its apparent simplicity.

When visiting the challenge URL, a webpage is served showing an image in the center. Although the CTF had ended, the page still contained a visual hint ‚Äî the flag was embedded in an image (`/flag.png`) but not immediately visible.

> Although it was not visible because the CTF had ended, the flag could be seen illegibly in the middle of the site

## üîç Analysis

1. **Initial Inspection**: Viewing the HTML source reveals an `<img>` element displaying `/flag.png`. This file was downloaded locally.

2. **Image Analysis**:

   * Initial inspection didn't reveal anything obvious.
   * Tried tools like [Incoherency Image Steganography Tool](https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide).
   * Applied various contrast and filter adjustments in an image editing tool to reveal the scrambled flag.

3. **Final Hint**: After trying several image manipulation methods, the hidden flag finally emerged from the scrambled pixels.
